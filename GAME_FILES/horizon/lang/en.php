The system of the game think that there was a perfectly equal exchange between the two players, while allowing a margin of 25% in favor of the player B.

- 3 technologies<br>
- 3 buildings on each planet possessed<br>
<br>
The advantage is to set the building construction and technology development so that your account continues to grow when you are away and you therefore can not launch them manually.<br>

The chain and fast modes are paying modes. However, it is possible to win by participating in events on the game (Quizz, Facebook etc). We advise you to keep you informed of the news of the game.<br>
