Suppose B send back an army of 100 000 000 u to player B,<br>
<br>
The system of the game think that there was a perfectly equal exchange between the two players, while allowing a margin of 25% in favor of the player B. The weak player (B) can therefore technically send for free 25 000 000 u (25% margin) to the strong player (A) because the system is not currently ability to detect the diversion of trade.<br>

The strong player (A) does not send something back in exchange, therefore enjoying free units sent by the weak player.<br>

In the details of their anti pushpage, the exchange will be marked as : <span class="vert">“Push margin : 25% legal trade.”</span><br>

<span class="orange">Therefore, it will not be tolerated to exchange to the tune of some or all of the 25 million units of the weak player to the strong player as permitted by the system.

<b>The "chain" mode</b> is a function to build/develop in a chain :<br>
<br>
- 3 technologies<br>
- 3 buildings on each planet possessed<br>
<br>
The advantage is to set the building construction and technology development so that your account continues to grow when you are away and you therefore can not launch them manually.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The "fast" mode</b> reduces all construction/development time (buildings, vessels, aircraft, defense, technology) by 20%. <br>

The chain and fast modes are paying modes. However, it is possible to win by participating in events on the game (Quizz, Facebook etc). We advise you to keep you informed of the news of the game.<br>
